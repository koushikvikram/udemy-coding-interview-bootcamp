The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures

## Problem Solving Process
1. **Understand** the problem in your own words and **analyze** it. **Never assume that you've done it before.** Does the problem have any **constraints** w.r.t time and space complexity, inputs, things to avoid, etc. **Are you allowed to modify the input?**
2. Input and Output types, how many inputs and outputs
3. Come up with examples and edge cases.
4. Break down the problem into **subproblems** and solve them independently,  think of strategies that might work and think about why the strategies might not work. Think about **patterns, data structures and algorithms** that you can use. Try out your strategy for specific cases (**debug on examples**), then generalize.
5. Write Pseudocode and think about **considerations while converting** pseudocode to real code.
6. Code your solution, then **simplify and optimize** code by checking for time and space complexity, code repetition, readability, code length, comments. **BUD** optimization - Bottlenecks, Unnecessary code, Duplicate code.
